# IOSDialog
The IOSDialog is a library, which allows to use an dialog and spinner elements as in IOS

I decided to do this because, it was necessary to me in one project. And then I decided to share with community.

Now the library has all necessary functions for implementation in your project. I will be engaged in its development further, but the main API will not change. And also you can contribute new idea to me.
